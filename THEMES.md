# Themes

Want to change the look of Icebreakers? Add your theme to the list below.

Each theme will be shown, in order, when the user pushes the "change theme" button.

The format is `_Theme Name_ #backround #foreground #highlight _Font Name_`

The theme name is arbitrary and not currently used anywhere, but may be used in the future. It must be unique. It should be formatted as `_Theme Name_`

The color values are in [hex format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors). The **background** color is the page background, the **foreground** color determines the _text_ and _icon_ colors, and the **highlight** color is the _visited link_ and _hover_ color. Example: [`#FAB709`](https://www.color-hex.com/color/fab709)

The font name is any [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Display) and determines the display font of the question. For instance, to use _[Irish Grover](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Irish+Grover?category=Display)_, it should be formatted as `_Irish Grover_`

Example: _Carnival_ below is formatted as `_Carnival_ #2B50AA #FF9FE5 #FF9FE5 _Rammetto One_`


* _Carnival_ #2B50AA #FF9FE5 #FF9FE5 _Rammetto One_
* _Amaranth Yellow_ #FFFC31 #AB2346 #AB2346 _Rammetto One_
