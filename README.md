# Icebreakers

Welcome to Icebreakers, a collection of icebreaking questions from around the web.

Try it out: <https://rendall.github.io/icebreakers/>

## FAQ:

### What is this?

Icebreaker questions are conversation starters you can ask to get to know someone, or to know your team. Load the site and it will present one of the thousands of questions in [the list](./QUESTIONS.md). Push the _Pick another question_ button to pick another question. If you want to go back to a previous question, push your browser's back button.

### These questions are terrible!

First, that's not even a question. But fair point. The questions are scraped from the web, and the quality is uneven. Go ahead and press that _pick another_ button.

Or, if you want to edit the questions, you can! Thank you for your help! This is an open-source project, so if there's a change you would like to see, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rendall/icebreakers/issues/new) or even better, [make the change yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model) and [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). There are so many options.

### How do I add questions?

The questions are all listed in the [QUESTIONS.md](./QUESTIONS.md) file. Add your questions to the bottom of the list, following the pattern, which is:

```markdown
* Credit: [Name of creator](https://creators.website)
  * This is the question?
  * In a list?
  * Underneath the Credit line?
```

Or [file an issue](https://github.com/rendall/icebreakers/issues/new).

### How do I edit or remove questions?

Remove or edit the question in question in the [QUESTIONS.md](./QUESTIONS.md) file then submit a pull request. Or [file an issue](https://github.com/rendall/icebreakers/issues/new).

### I'm the copyright owner and I want my questions removed!

First, that's not a question, but understood. Second, are you sure? You're credited, and it drives traffic to your page. But if you insist, there are many ways to contact me, but the easiest is to [file an issue](https://github.com/rendall/icebreakers/issues/new) and I'll take it down.

### I'm a copyright owner. How would I go about adding my website?

No problem! [Fill out this form.](https://github.com/rendall/icebreakers/issues/new)

### Are you interested in monetization opportunities?

Not in the slightest. But the license allows you to do that yourself without my permission. Knock yourself out! Let me know how it goes.
